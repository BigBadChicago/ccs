I'll go through some of the big ones and show you what they actually mean. It feels like people like to say big words to make themselves sound smarter. Unfortunately after you start working with them, it becomes second nature and you forget that not everyone knows your jargon. We'll dig into some types of morphisms, currying and partial application (There's a difference?!), monads, algebraic data types, and more. While you may leave the talk not understanding all of these things, you will at least have an overview of all of them and some guidance about where to learn more. "},

Q: But isn't it true that using Rails is extremely simple to use even if I haven't done Ruby before? A: Yes. Q: So Rails is what I should you use build Ruby web applications? A: Maybe.If Rails is a hammer, it's my goal to show you that your next project may need nails. I hope to show you the benefits of how using simple Ruby can put you on the path to better application design. I'll also show you a few tools of the Rubyist's trade that enable you to build a modular web application from emerging needs of your problem space.
