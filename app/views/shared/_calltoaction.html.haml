  So, you're checking out the source code for the site? Cool, glad to know you care. :)
  If you're interested, we could really use your help.
  \
  This site is actually a Rails 2.3.5 application running on Heroku. We're using Blueprint for the layout and HAML
  for the markup. The source is hosted on GitHub and is licensed under the GPL. Does that sound like something you'd
  like to help out on?
  \
  Still with me? Okay, good. I'd really like your help. Basically, this site is intended to become a template that
  can be used to help other code camp (or similar) events get up and running quickly with a site that can ...
  \
  1. Get a blurb site up and running quickly and cheaply.
  2. Allow for submitting presentations for your event in a fun and easy way.
  3. Allow for the event organizers to load up and populate the events info
  4. Present a list of speakers, once they are ready.
  5. Present a list of sessions, once they too are ready.
  6. Anything else that we may not have thought about yet but would be nice for organizers and attendees.
  \
  All that is cool and all, but what do we *really* need? (In no particular order)
  \
  \# Design = we need someone who can make this site BEAUTIFUL but easily customizable. Not everyone shares my design
  aesthetic.
  \# Interactivity = the scripting on the site is very rudimentary right now. If we could give the site a bit of PIZAZZ
  KERBLAM-WOW type effects that would be great. But also subtle things like Ajax-ified forms and nice validation.
  \
  What is the site not really intended for?
  \
  \# Multi-tenant application = this is really just intended to be a simple application for hosting a single event.
  There's nothing preventing the same installation being used year-to-year but it's not really intended to simultaneously
  be used for multiple events.
  \# User-group Management = there's a subtle but significant difference between a single event that may even span
  multiple days and an ongoing series of events. To make this the best possible option for singular events I want
  to just focus on that. There is too much complexity in ongoing events and that will just be a distraction from
  this applications goal.
  \
  Given all that, are you still interested in helping? Do you have ideas?
